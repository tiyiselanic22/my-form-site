  <h1>Disaster Recovery Plan</h1>
  <p>The Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) provides structured steps to restore IT operations following a system failure, cyberattack, or data loss. Its goal is to ensure business continuity by minimizing downtime and preventing data corruption. All employees must be familiar with these recovery measures and act promptly when an incident occurs.</p>

  <p><strong>Terms and Conditions:</strong> The IT Department performs daily data backups, stored securely both on-site and off-site. In the event of a major failure, restoration begins from the most recent verified backup. The IT Manager coordinates the recovery process while the IT Technician performs the technical restoration and verifies data integrity.</p>

  <p>After recovery, all incidents are analyzed to identify the cause and improve the response plan. The Secretary documents every recovery event, and the Manager submits a final report with recommendations for system improvement.</p>

  <p>If you experience a data error or accidental deletion, contact the IT team immediately for guidance. Avoid performing additional changes that could worsen the issue, and await instructions from authorized IT personnel.</p>

  <h2>Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)</h2>

  <p>The Disaster Recovery Plan defines a structured and organized process for recovering critical IT services after any unexpected interruption such as cyberattacks, hardware damage, system corruption, or natural disasters. Its purpose is to minimize downtime, prevent permanent data loss, and ensure that learning and business operations resume as quickly and safely as possible. The plan is designed to protect not only company data but also the integrity of every educational platform used by learners and staff.</p>

  <p>Games for Learning follows a detailed recovery procedure that outlines each stage from detection to full restoration. These procedures are continuously reviewed, tested, and refined to ensure reliability under real-world conditions. All IT staff are trained to understand their specific responsibilities and communication flow during recovery operations.</p>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Recovery Process</h2>

  <p>The first step in any disaster recovery situation is <strong>incident identification and reporting</strong>. The staff member or system monitoring tool that detects a problem must immediately alert the IT Manager and Team Leader. Accurate logging of the time, location, and nature of the incident is crucial. Once reported, the Manager evaluates the scale of the incident and declares whether a full disaster recovery response is needed or if it can be handled through normal troubleshooting procedures.</p>

  <p>The second step involves <strong>containment and isolation</strong> of the affected systems. To prevent the disaster from spreading—for example, in the case of malware or network intrusion—the IT Technician isolates the impacted servers or devices from the network. This ensures that the rest of the infrastructure remains secure and functional while assessment and repair are underway.</p>

  <p>The third step is <strong>damage assessment and prioritization</strong>. During this phase, the IT team evaluates which systems, databases, or applications were affected. The priority is always given to systems that are essential for learners and ongoing classes. The Team Leader coordinates this process while the IT Technician provides technical diagnostics and documentation for each affected system.</p>

  <p>Next, the department initiates the <strong>data recovery phase</strong>. The IT Technician retrieves the most recent secure backups from both the cloud and off-site repositories. Restorations are carried out in a controlled environment where data integrity can be verified before full deployment. The Manager and Team Leader monitor this process to ensure compliance with data security standards and to confirm that recovered data matches operational needs.</p>

  <p>Once the systems are restored, the fifth step focuses on <strong>verification and testing</strong>. The IT team conducts extensive testing to confirm that every service, database, and application is operating normally. This includes checking user logins, software functionality, and internal network communication. Any inconsistencies are logged and corrected immediately before access is granted back to end users.</p>

  <p>The sixth step is <strong>system reintegration and communication</strong>. After full verification, the IT Department reconnects all restored systems to the main network. Users are informed through internal communication channels that operations have resumed. Employees are reminded to change their passwords and follow security recommendations if the incident involved a security breach.</p>

  <p>The final step involves <strong>post-incident review and documentation</strong>. The Team Leader compiles a full report detailing the cause of the incident, actions taken, resources used, recovery duration, and any lessons learned. This report is shared with management to improve future prevention strategies and strengthen overall disaster resilience.</p>

  <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

  <p>Only authorized IT personnel are permitted to participate in the recovery process. Employees are not allowed to attempt data recovery or hardware repair on their own. The organization reserves the right to monitor, document, and store all incident recovery data for audit and compliance purposes. All recovery actions must be approved by the IT Manager before implementation. Failure to follow these terms may result in disciplinary action and system access restrictions.</p>

  <h2>User Guidance and Reporting</h2>

  <p>In cases where employees or learners accidentally delete files or experience unexpected data corruption, they must report the incident immediately using the <a href="helpdesk.html">Help Desk page</a> or email <strong>ITdesign@gmail.com</strong>. The IT Department will assess the severity of the issue and initiate a recovery request. Users are encouraged to describe the file name, date, and approximate time of the incident to help the technician locate and restore the correct version from the backup archive.</p>

  <p>This plan emphasizes prevention as much as recovery. Routine data backups, continuous security monitoring, and scheduled recovery drills are essential to ensuring that Games for Learning can withstand and recover from any form of digital disruption. The IT Department remains committed to maintaining operational continuity, protecting educational content, and preserving user confidence in every system we operate.</p>
