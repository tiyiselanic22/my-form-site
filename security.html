  <h1>IT Security Policy</h1>
  <p>The IT Security Policy establishes the framework that protects all digital resources, systems, and data within the organization. Every user is responsible for maintaining security by using strong passwords, regularly updating them, and avoiding unauthorized software installations. Access to systems is granted based on job relevance and requires proper authorization from management.</p>

  <p>All computers are protected by antivirus software, and regular system audits are performed to detect and mitigate threats. Sensitive data, such as client information and internal records, must be encrypted and stored securely. Employees are also required to lock their workstations when unattended to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

  <p><strong>Terms and Conditions:</strong> Users must not share login credentials, connect unapproved devices to the network, or use company systems for personal gain. Breaches of these terms will lead to disciplinary action and possible revocation of IT privileges.</p>

  <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Strong IT security ensures data integrity, customer trust, and operational stability. It prevents financial loss and enhances compliance with data protection laws. <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> It can limit user flexibility and require additional resources for constant monitoring and updates. However, the benefits of protecting organizational data far outweigh the minor inconveniences.</p>

  <p>If you identify a potential security issue, please report it immediately via the <a href="contact.html">contact form</a> or email the IT department at <strong>support@companymail.com</strong>.</p>
