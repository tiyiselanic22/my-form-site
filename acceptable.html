  <h1>Acceptable Use Policy</h1>
  <p>The Acceptable Use Policy defines the proper and ethical use of all IT systems, devices, and networks provided by the organization. Employees are expected to use technology strictly for work-related tasks and maintain professional conduct in all digital communications. The policy prohibits accessing harmful websites, sharing unauthorized files, or using social media for non-work activities during working hours.</p>

  <p>Company emails must be used for professional communication only, and data must be handled with confidentiality. Staff should avoid copying sensitive information to external drives or cloud storage without approval. Downloading or installing software without IT authorization is strictly forbidden as it may compromise system security.</p>

  <p>This policy promotes accountability, prevents cyber threats, and ensures equitable use of shared resources. Failure to comply with these terms may lead to disciplinary action or termination of system access privileges.</p>
