  <h1>Acquisition Procedures and Approvals</h1>
  <p>All IT acquisitions must follow a structured procedure to ensure transparency, cost efficiency, and alignment with departmental needs. When a staff member identifies the need for new equipment or software, a requisition form must be submitted to the IT Manager for evaluation. The Manager then verifies the necessity, compatibility, and budget availability before approval.</p>

  <p>For example, if the IT Technician requests new switches for network expansion, the request is assessed for technical justification, approved by the Manager, and logged by the Secretary for financial documentation. The procurement team then purchases the equipment following internal financial controls and vendor guidelines.</p>

  <p>This procedure guarantees that all acquisitions support long-term operational goals while preventing overspending or duplication of resources. Any unauthorized purchase will not be reimbursed and may lead to formal review or disciplinary action.</p>

        <h1>Acquisition Process</h1>
        
        <div class="intro">
            <p>The Acquisition phase is a critical part of the IT and organizational Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), as it ensures that the procurement of technology, equipment, software, and services aligns with business goals, policies, and budgetary frameworks. The goal is to make informed purchasing decisions that guarantee value, compliance, and long-term operational efficiency.</p>
            
            <p>The process begins with needs identification, where departments determine what resources are required to support their functions. This may include new hardware, updated software licenses, network components, or cloud-based services. Once needs are clearly defined, the IT department collaborates with management to create a detailed acquisition plan that includes timelines, costs, and vendor specifications.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Steps in the Acquisition Process</h2>
        
        <div class="step">
            <strong>1. Requirement Assessment:</strong> Each department submits a formal request outlining the purpose, specifications, and expected outcomes of the acquisition. The IT and finance teams review these requests to ensure they align with organizational priorities and technical compatibility.
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <strong>2. Market Research and Vendor Evaluation:</strong> The procurement or IT team researches potential vendors to identify those who meet both the technical and financial requirements. Vendors are evaluated based on reliability, warranty, service quality, and compliance with industry standards.
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <strong>3. Budget Approval and Authorization:</strong> Before any purchase is made, the proposal is reviewed by management and finance for approval. This ensures the purchase is cost-effective and within the allocated budget.
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <strong>4. Procurement and Contracting:</strong> Once approved, purchase orders are issued, and contracts are signed with selected vendors. The contracts must include detailed terms of service, maintenance agreements, and delivery expectations.
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <strong>5. Delivery, Installation, and Testing:</strong> Upon delivery, all equipment and software are inspected to confirm they meet the specified requirements. The IT team installs and configures the assets while performing security and performance tests.
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <strong>6. Documentation and Inventory Registration:</strong> Every asset acquired is recorded in the organization's asset management system. Documentation includes vendor details, warranty information, serial numbers, and maintenance schedules.
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <strong>7. Post-Acquisition Review:</strong> After installation, the IT department conducts a review to ensure the acquired products or services function as intended. Any discrepancies are reported to the vendor for resolution.
        </div>

        <h2>Quality and Compliance</h2>
        <p>The acquisition process follows strict quality assurance standards to maintain compliance with internal policies and external regulations. Every procurement must also consider data protection, cybersecurity policies, and environmental impact. For instance, purchasing eco-friendly equipment and choosing vendors that comply with data security frameworks like ISO 27001 enhances organizational sustainability and integrity.</p>

        <h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IT Manager:</strong> Oversees the acquisition process, ensures technical requirements are met, and approves final procurement.</li>
            <li><strong>Finance Department:</strong> Confirms budget availability and validates cost justification.</li>
            <li><strong>Procurement Officer:</strong> Handles vendor communication, contract management, and order processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Department Heads:</strong> Identify needs, justify requests, and ensure acquired items meet functional goals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges and Risk Management</h2>
        <p>Common acquisition challenges include supplier delays, cost overruns, incompatible systems, and compliance issues. To mitigate these, the organization adopts a risk assessment strategy that evaluates potential risks before purchases are made. Regular vendor audits and feedback sessions also ensure continuous improvement.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>A well-structured acquisition process ensures that all technological and operational resources acquired serve the organization's mission efficiently and securely. It helps maintain transparency, reduce costs, and promote accountability across departments.</p>
