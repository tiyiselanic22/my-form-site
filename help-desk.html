  <h1>Help Desk Procedures</h1>
  <p>The IT Help Desk provides essential support to all users experiencing technical challenges. Its primary role is to resolve hardware, software, and connectivity issues in a timely and organized manner. The Help Desk operates as the first line of communication between users and technical specialists.</p>

  <p>Users who require assistance should contact the Help Desk by completing a support form on the company intranet or sending an email to <strong>support@companymail.com</strong>. Once a ticket is logged, it is prioritized based on urgency—critical issues such as network failures are handled immediately, while general support requests are processed in queue order.</p>

  <p>IT Technicians assigned to the Help Desk are responsible for diagnosing problems, documenting resolutions, and following up with users to confirm satisfaction. The Help Desk aims to reduce downtime, improve productivity, and ensure a consistent user experience across the organization.</p>
